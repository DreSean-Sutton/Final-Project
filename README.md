# the-ultimate-api

A full stack web application for Smash Ultimate loving devs who want to incorporate raw stats into their own applications.

### Why build this?

Well, Smash Ultimate is an excellent contender for my favorite game, so I made a frame data viewing app for it. I pulled my data from the best Smash API on the market, the [KuroganeHammer API](https://github.com/Frannsoft/FrannHammer). However, it is outdated and unmaintained for Smash Ultimate. In an effort to fill the gap for me and other developers, I decided to build my own database and give back to the Smash community.
